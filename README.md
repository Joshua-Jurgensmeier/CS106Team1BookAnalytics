To do:
Ideas for methods we had previously come up with:
  Total word count
  Unique word count
  Contains word - Josh
  Random sentence - Josh
  Palindrome count
  (Maybe) Replace and save

More ideas:
  Print all stats
  Top five most common words
  Some stuff to compare different books
  Basic word length stats: avg, range
  letter count.

We also need to make the UI, anyone especially interested?
